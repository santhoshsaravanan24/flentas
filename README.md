EC2 WEBSITE HOSTING TASK

I launched a Free Tier EC2 instance (t2.micro) inside a public subnet so that it could be accessed from the internet. I assigned it a public IP and configured the security group to allow only the required traffic—HTTP (port 80) from anywhere and SSH (port 22) restricted to my own IP for secure access.After launching the instance, I connected to it using AWS EC2 Instance Connect. I installed Nginx, which acts as a lightweight web server for hosting static pages. Once Nginx was running, I uploaded my resume (static HTML/CSS) to the default Nginx directory (/usr/share/nginx/html/). This allowed the resume website to load whenever someone accessed the instance’s public IP.For basic infrastructure hardening, I restricted SSH access, removed unnecessary packages, enabled automatic updates, and ensured that only port 80 was publicly exposed. This improves security while keeping the website accessible.When the setup was complete, opening the public IP in a browser displayed my resume as a static website served by Nginx.
